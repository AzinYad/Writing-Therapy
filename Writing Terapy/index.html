        <h2> Next time you find yourself having a negative thought, from a specific anxiety (“My friend hates me because
            she didn’t
            respond to my text!”) to a hazy emotion (“I’m feeling really bad about myself today!”), stop yourself and
            ask, What am I
            thinking right now?</h2>
            <h2> Then write it down, either in a notebook, random word doc, or dedicated app.</h2>

            <h2>The good thing about writing here is once you refresh the page it's all gone,
                as you don't need to carry all these heavy thoughts with you anymore and you already feel so much lighter writing it,
                reading and reconsidering it, you are ready to leave it behind. </h2>
