USER STORY

The goal is Making it possible for a user to add a comment on my website (the comment won't get saved anywhere, so it will disappear when the page is refreshed )

I made the Javascript code by using CYF Block project , and insert the generated code into my vs project ==> https://tinyurl.com/CFY-Project

Then I thought what would be the usage of a text area like this and writing therapy came to my mind . 

I also searched about charities that helping people to overcome their emotional roller coaster through talking, 
so I added some  information in footer  as it might be useful.
